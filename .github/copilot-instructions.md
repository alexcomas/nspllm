# GitHub Copilot Instructions for NSPLLM

This project implements **Generative Agents** with neuro-symbolic planning extensions. It combines LLM-driven cognitive modules with symbolic planning for coherent, believable AI agents in simulated environments.

### Change Management
- **Incremental Changes**: Make changes in reasonable, reviewable chunks. Stop after implementing a complete, logical unit of work rather than accumulating large changes across multiple files.
- **File Digestibility**: Ensure each change set produces files that are easy to understand and review. Break down complex features into smaller, focused pull requests.
- **Validation First**: Run tests and linters after each meaningful change to catch issues early and maintain code quality.
