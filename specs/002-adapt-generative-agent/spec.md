# Feature Specification: Adapt Generative Agent Codebase for Neuro-Symbolic Planning

**Feature Branch**: `002-adapt-generative-agent`  
**Created**: September 18, 2025  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "Adapt Generative Agent codebase for Neuro-Symbolic Planning to enhance coherence and believability in LLM-driven agents, supporting different planning modules, LLM providers, newest paradigms, improved prompts structure, and evaluation setup for human testing and constraints."

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies  
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a researcher conducting a master thesis on neuro-symbolic planning for LLM-driven agents, I need to adapt the existing Generative Agent codebase to support multiple planning modules, different LLM providers, modern LLM paradigms, improved prompt structures, and evaluation frameworks for human testing and constraint validation, so that I can enhance agent coherence and believability while maintaining flexibility for experimentation.

### Acceptance Scenarios 
1. **Given** the adapted codebase, **When** I switch between different LLM providers, **Then** the agent should continue functioning 

### Edge Cases
- What happens when a planning module fails to initialize?
- How does the system handle LLM provider rate limits or outages?


## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST support pluggable planning modules that can be switched at runtime
- **FR-002**: System MUST support multiple LLM providers with consistent interface abstraction
- **FR-003**: System MUST implement newest LLM paradigms that is Function calling, Structured output. 
- **FR-004**: System MUST be compatible with current implementation of reverie engine.
